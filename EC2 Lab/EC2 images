# Lab 11 â€“ Amazon EBS Volumes and Snapshots

## ðŸ§  Overview

In this lab, I learned how to work with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, which provide durable, high-performance storage for EC2 instances. I practiced creating, attaching, mounting, and backing up EBS volumes using snapshots.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this lab, I was able to:

- Create a new EBS volume
- Attach the volume to an existing EC2 instance
- Mount the EBS volume to make it usable by the instance
- Create a snapshot (backup) of the EBS volume
- Launch a new volume from the snapshot

---

## ðŸ”§ What I Did (Steps Overview)

1. Created a new EBS volume in the same Availability Zone as the EC2 instance
2. Attached the volume to the EC2 instance using the AWS Console
3. Connected to the EC2 instance using SSH and mounted the EBS volume
4. Verified the volume was available using Linux commands (e.g., `lsblk`, `df -h`)
5. Created a snapshot of the volume as a backup
6. Used the snapshot to create a new volume
7. Verified that the new volume contained the same data as the original

âœ… **Lab Completion:**

This lab was successfully completed when I:
- Attached and mounted a working EBS volume to an EC2 instance
- Created a snapshot as a backup
- Recovered the data using a new volume made from the snapshot

Now I understand how EBS volumes work with EC2 and how snapshots can be used for backup and recovery.
